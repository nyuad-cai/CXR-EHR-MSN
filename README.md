# Project overview:



## Abstract:

Self-supervised learning methods for medical imaging primarily rely on image data for pretraining. While this approach delivers promising results, incorporating associated information from Electronic Health Records (EHR) can enhance the quality of the learned representation. In this paper, we investigate the impact of incorporating three groups of EHR data including socio-demographic, scan metadata, and inpatient stay information during the pretraining on downstream task performance. We experiment with all possible combinations of these three groups as well as their single variables, using the Masked Siamese Network (MSN) self-supervised learning architecture. We evaluate our proposal on three publicly available chest X-ray datasets (MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert, and NIH14) using two vision transformer (ViT) backbones, ViT-Tiny and ViT-Small, under linear evaluation and low-data regime fine-tuning. Our approach shows significant improvement as compared to vanilla MSN and superior performance as compared state-of-the-art self-supervised learning baselines. Our work highlights the potential of EHR-enhanced pretraining and opens opportunities for future research to address limitations in existing representation learning methods for other medical imaging modalities, such as neuro-, ophthalmic, and sonar imaging
